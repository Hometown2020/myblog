      <description>We are delighted to be able to inform the reader, that during the whole of this scene, Gringoire and his piece had stood firm. His actors, spurred on by him, had not ceased to spout his comedy, and he had not ceased to listen to it. He had made up his mind about the tumult, and was determined to proceed to the end, not giving up the hope of a return of attention on the part of the public.</description>

      <description>In the twinkling of an eye, all was ready to execute Coppenole’s idea. Bourgeois, scholars and law clerks all set to work. The little chapel situated opposite the marble table was selected for the scene of the grinning match. A pane broken in the pretty rose window above the door, left free a circle of stone through which it was agreed that the competitors should thrust their heads. In order to reach it, it was only necessary to mount upon a couple of hogsheads, which had been produced from I know not where, and perched one upon the other, after a fashion.</description>

      <description>While the pensioner of Ghent and his eminence were exchanging very low bows and a few words in voices still lower, a man of lofty stature, with a large face and broad shoulders, presented himself, in order to enter abreast with Guillaume Rym; one would have pronounced him a bull-dog by the side of a fox. His felt doublet and leather jerkin made a spot on the velvet and silk which surrounded him.</description>

      <description>Poor Gringoire! the din of all the great double petards of the Saint-Jean, the discharge of twenty arquebuses on supports, the detonation of that famous serpentine of the Tower of Billy, which, during the siege of Paris, on Sunday, the twenty-sixth of September, 1465, killed seven Burgundians at one blow, the explosion of all the powder stored at the gate of the Temple, would have rent his ears less rudely at that solemn and dramatic moment, than these few words, which fell from the lips of the usher, “His eminence, Monseigneur the Cardinal de Bourbon.</description>

      <description>Nevertheless, as be harangued them, the satisfaction and admiration unanimously excited by his costume were dissipated by his words; and when he reached that untoward conclusion: “As soon as his illustrious eminence, the cardinal, arrives, we will begin,” his voice was drowned in a thunder of hooting.
“Begin instantly! The mystery! the mystery immediately!” shrieked the people. And above all the voices, that of Johannes de Molendino was audible, piercing the uproar like the fife’s derisive serenade: “Commence instantly!</description>

      <description>Three hundred and forty-eight years, six months, and nineteen days ago to-day, the Parisians awoke to the sound of all the bells in the triple circuit of the city, the university, and the town ringing a full peal.
The sixth of January, 1482, is not, however, a day of which history has preserved the memory. There was nothing notable in the event which thus set the bells and the bourgeois of Paris in a ferment from early morning.</description>

      <description>Hugo+github 构建个人博客（Windows环境下） 前言 由于在GitHub上部署博客跟在gitee上的流程基本一致，所以本文只给出了在GitHub上部署的差别以及可能出现的问题的处理。具体流程参考：用Hugo在gitee上构建博客（Windows环境下）
Differences   https vs SSH
  区别：前者可以随意克隆github上的项目，而不管是谁的；而后者则是你必须是你要克隆的项目的拥有者或管理员，且需要先添加 SSH key ，否则无法克隆
  在GitHub上添加SSH key方法
详见https://www.cnblogs.com/ayseeing/p/3572582.html
    新建的github的仓库名必须为 用户名+github.io
  将文件上传到GitHub前应先pull
   git pull &amp;ndash;rebase origin master
   再上传
 git push -u origin master
     上传的内容需master分支中可查看
  上传到GitHub后部署网站  在Settings找到Github Pages，如图： xxxxxxxxx 图中的地址就是个人博客的地址了  常见问题 Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind   方法一</description>
